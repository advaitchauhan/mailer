Hi /#1#/,

My name is Advait Chauhan, and I’m a sophomore CS Major and entrepreneurship club officer at Princeton University. A friend of mine at Columbia forwarded me your contact and suggested that /#2#/ might be interested in attending Princeton’s first start-up career fair, which we are working hard to organize and will be occurring on February 20th, 2015. 

Our goal as a team is to disrupt current recruiting trends at Princeton (which heavily favor finance,consulting, and tech giants) and encourage students to realize their entrepreneurial potential by working at start-ups.  Specifically, we seek to increase the opportunities for Princeton students of all years to work at innovative start-ups, and equivalently for startups to increase their exposure and recruitment at Princeton.
 
We therefore invite you to attend Princeton’s first Start-Up Only Career Fair this upcoming February. This event will be quite unlike any traditional career fair. For a nominal fee of $100, you’ll be able to exclusively talk to and receive applications from a self-selecting, diverse pool of talented students who are specifically interested in working at small startups.  Some of these students will be skilled underclassmen with limited internships options (simply due to age) who will be especially keen to work in the start-up space and learn everything they can!
 
The nature of this event is such that it will foster genuine communication and matching of student interests with employers, something hard to come by in both traditional career fairs and online recruiting systems. You will also be provided with a resume book at the end of the event and a number of guaranteed applications.
 
If you are interested in this opportunity to recruit talented students and help us change the recruiting culture at Princeton, and/or would like to know more, please reach out to me by email or give me a call at 301-821-5311. I would love to talk!
 
Best,
Advait Chauhan
